UnitConverter
=============

This is a small unit converter developed according to the "User Centered Design" as part of a seminar paper.
Its written in Java(1.6) and is entirely labeled in german due to the seminar's language.

The software is designed to pupils of every age. However it is seperated into two surfaces:
"Sekundarstufe 1" - for pupils up to year 10
"Sekundarstufe 2" - senior classes

The core of this frontend is made up of the JScience library. The unit converter serves the purpose of evaluating the usability and user acceptance.
